# Comparative genomics of _Clostridioides difficile_ (CD) phages

In this study, all available sequenced CD phage genome data were extracted. Based on shared protein content phages were grouped into nine clusters without any singleton. An updated taxonomy was suggested for CD phages based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) among the phages, core genes within cluster members, and proteomic phylogeny. Creation of three novel families, 23 new genera were proposed and elevation of currently assigned genera by ICTV to subfamilies. Furthermore, endolysin and holin proteins were explored. Domain prediction and phylogenetic analysis revealed the diversity of the endolysin. Additionally, selection pressure analysis on endolysin and holin genes revealed highly purifying selection acting on the said genes.
